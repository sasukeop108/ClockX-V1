## 1/7/2026 5 AM - Designed OLED UI  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

**DAY** 1

Today, I designed a good user interface for my OLED display using lopaka. It turned out  very well. I also include options to use Clock and Game seperately. It took me 45 mins but UI was worth for spending the time.![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzY1MzIsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--bfd9dbf3e955d261bfb9b55eff037bc0dc11b172/image.png)
  

## 1/7/2026 8 AM - Designed circuit diagram  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

**DAY 1** ![circuitDiagram](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzY3NTcsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--e08883894acb29f5032da1b3252f314fee702a78/circuitDiagram.png)
Today, I spent 1 hour and to choose components and complete my circuit diagram. I added all the components needed for the project and connected them. Finally i checked all the wiring and ensured that there were no mistakes in the wiring part.

  

## 1/8/2026 - Started coding for the proect  

_Time spent: 1.3h_  

**DAY 2**![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Nzc4OTUsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--fae0f42767656f91618a829eb374aac3371e1242/image.png)

Today, I started coding for my project's NTP clock part. Learnt basics ofu8g2, NTPClient and wrote this code. I had many syntax errors in my code. After compiling, Found 6 syntax errors which i fixed immediately.

My code had some declaration and software errors too which i also fixed and compiled again. This time, There were no errors and NTP CLOCK part was good to go. I completed 1 part out of the 3 parts of my project which are NTP clock, Game and ALARM.

**TIME SPENT** : Around 1 hour & 30 mins  

  

## 1/9/2026 - Completed coding the project  

_Time spent: 3.4h_  

**DAY 3**![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzkxNDcsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--22e5b61d24dc1baf2ff50f68dc7f5fab15f66c80/image.png)

Today, I modified the code which i wrote yesterday. The code which i wrote yesterday was too 
basic, So today i modified all the basic code to advanced which was pretty cool at first. After completing the code, I realized that the button management was too complex.

Due to the complexity of button handling i added a setting in menu which will display all the button handling. Also, The previous code only had clock, But today i added all the parts (games,settings,alarm). Like always had many errors which i fixed.

**time spent**: 3.45 Hour.  

## 1/10/2026 - Created BOM and changed circuit diagram  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

**DAY 4**![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODAwNTcsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--a9e0eaf69ac4d12d449b89b9902e6202b68407b5/image.png)

Today, There were several changes in my project. I changed the micro controller from esp8266 to wemos d1 mini because of its very small size. Because oh this i also was forced to create a new circuit diagram. i did it.

Also, I created the BOM of my project using excel. This might be the final journal of my project because my project is in final phase which is prototyping.


**TIME SPENT**: 2 hours
